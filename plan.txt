	task2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. use Harris detector to find key points
2. use SIFT or other feature descriptor to extract features of these key points
3. match key points between images and compare their feature distance
4. after have matched your point pairs --
	- compute the homography matrix using RANSAC algorithm
5. use the homography matrix to stitch the images together.

rules:
~~~~~~
<you can use other methods too as long as you get this working>
<numpy and opencv is allowed >
<EXCEPT stitch api >



It is recommended to install
opencv-contrib-python by “pip install opencv-contrib-python”

then use -- 
cv2.xfeatures2d.SIFT create()


has to run under a min.




img_ = orig right
img  = orig left

img1 = gray right ==> kp1 
img2 = gray left  ==> kp2


right image to turn and shit
